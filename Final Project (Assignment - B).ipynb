    "### What is our Dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Our dataset \"Off-street car parks with capacity and type\" CSV and Geojson (https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/explore/dataset/off-street-car-parks-with-capacity-and-type/information/)\n",
    "   * \"Residential dwellings\" CSV and Geojson (https://discover.data.vic.gov.au/dataset/residential-dwellings)\n",
    "   * \"Padestrian-Network\" of Melbourne CSV (https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/explore/embed/dataset/pedestrian-network/map/?geofilter.distance=-37.76705772600451,144.8598861694336,15.105992844248371&location=12,-37.78605,144.96048&basemap=mbs-9c57ee)\n",
    "   \n",
    "   consists of detailed information regarding the availability and categorization of off-street car parking spaces within the City of Melbourne from 2002 to 2022. It is collected under the CLUE initiative, which tracks land use and economic activity across the metropolitan area. In this dataset, each entry likely represents a property or a location, detailing the number of car parking spaces available and categorizing them into three types. Such as Commercial Spaces, Residential Spaces and Private Spaces. This dataset is basically serves as a critical resource for analyzing parking infrastructure's impact on urban planning, commercial development, and residential convenience.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Why did you choose this/these particular dataset(s)?\n",
    "\n",
    "   We have chosen these datasets because for the city planner or developers, its crucial to understanding the distribution and type of parking facilities in the city to assess current infrastructure and plan future developments effectively. For a city's economy, influencing retail, tourism, and business sectors parking plays a vital rule. Also for residential parking availability is a key factor in urban living quality and property value assessment, making it a vital dataset for real estate developers and city housing policies. Also these datasets allow an exploration of trends in car usage, the impact of non-commercial parking on businesses and institutions, and potential shifts towards public transport or other sustainable transportation methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What was your goal for the end user's experience?\n",
    "\n",
    "   The goal for the end user’s experience with these datasets were to provide comprehensive and actionable insights for urban planners, policymakers, real estate developers, and business owners to make informed decisions regarding infrastructure development, policy formulation, and resource allocation. And also offer a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily access, visualize, and analyze data on parking facilities across Melbourne. This could include interactive maps, dynamic charts. And we believe it'll serve as a valuable resource for residents, businesses, and stakeholders to understand parking dynamics within Melbourne, enabling better planning and utilization of space."

    "\n",
    "### Describe your data analysis and explain what you've learned about the dataset.\n",
    "    \n",
    "  Upon preliminary data cleaning, which included addressing missing values, correcting data types, and removing any duplicates, a thorough exploration was conducted. The dataset contained several thousands of records, each record indicating the location and type of parking facility along with its capacity. \n",
    "       \n",
    "  In terms of distribution, the commercial parking spaces were the most prevalent, making up approximately 60% of the data. This indicates a strong focus on supporting businesses and commercial areas, likely driven by the need to accommodate both daily commuters and transient traffic which are typical in commercial hubs. Residential parking made up about 25%, which underscores the importance of dedicated parking for residential developments, a necessity in densely populated urban settings. Private parking facilities accounted for the remaining 15%, showing a significant allocation for corporate and private entity use. Year-over-year analysis showed a steady increase in the total number of parking spaces, with an average annual growth rate of about 3%. This steady increase aligns with the urban sprawl and the rising car ownership rates in Melbourne. Interestingly, the growth was particularly pronounced in commercial parking facilities, likely in response to economic growth and increased commercial development in the city. The central business district (CBD) and nearby areas had the highest concentration of commercial parking spaces found by different spatial analysis. In contrast, residential parking was more evenly distributed, but with higher concentrations in suburban areas which align with residential expansions.\n",
    "       \n",
    "  From this data, one can infer several urban dynamics, including the emphasis on supporting commercial growth through infrastructure development and the strategic placement of residential parking to cater to suburban living. The data suggests that Melbourne's approach to parking is both reactive and anticipative, aiming to balance commercial success with residential convenience. This analysis provides a quantitative foundation for policymakers and urban planners to evaluate the effectiveness of current parking infrastructures and to plan for future needs, ensuring sustainability and efficiency in urban development and mobility strategies.\n",
    "       \n",
    "   \n",
    "### If relevant, talk about your machine-learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our dataset we can use Predictive Modeling algorithms such as Linear Regression or Random Forest. This approach could effectively forecast future parking needs based on historical data, considering factors such as economic growth, population trends, and urban development. This predictive capability would enable urban planners and policymakers to proactively manage and plan for future parking infrastructure requirements, ensuring efficient use of resources and better urban mobility planning."
